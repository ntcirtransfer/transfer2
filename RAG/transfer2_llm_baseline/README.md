This is a baseline for LLM-based answer generation based on the DPR retrieval results
environment is the same to that of transfer2_llamaindex_baseline

preparation
- just copy dataset directory from FiDbaseline (we don't write any files into this directory, so the symbolic link can be used)
- download DPR retrieval results from google drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wboq09_eiegKQsoovPIpKs6VAxYT2Gxk/view?usp=drive_link) and unzip them

``python run.py``
