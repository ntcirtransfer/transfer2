This is a baseline for LLM-based answer generation based on the DPR retrieval results
environment is the same to that of transfer2_llamaindex_baseline

preparation
- just copy dataset directory from FiDbaseline (we don't write any files into this directory, so the symbolic link can be used)
``python run.py``
